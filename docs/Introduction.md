# Introduction

The **Organisation Identifier List of Lists** is a structure codelist and information source, that should enable users to discover sources of high-quality, stable organisation identifiers to use for any organisation type, country or sector.

To do this requires in-depth research that can:

* Clearly document the nature of any list. For example, is it a primary register of companies, or is it a secondary list used by government to identify contractors.

* Assign a prefix to each list.

* Provide structured meta-data about the jurisdictions covered, the kind of organisations, and the availability of open data.

* Identify mappings between different identifier lists. Such as when, for example, a charity register includes the company numbers of companies that are also charities.

* Capture ‘Need to know’ information that it is important for data publishers and users to be aware of.

  This may be information about particular legal forms of organisation in a country, or facts about the identifiers in a particular list.

This handbook includes information on how to carry out research to populate and update the codelist.
