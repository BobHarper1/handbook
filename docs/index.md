org-id.guide: contributors handbook
========================================

Information about organizations is more valuable when it includes:

* An unambiguous **organization identifier**

* The official legal name of the organization

* Other identifying information

org-id.guide provides a register of lists that provide organization identifiers. 

**Quality**

org-id.guide assigns a code that can be used to refer to each list. It ranks the quality of the lists based on the **stablility and accuracy** and the **availability of open data**. 

The higher the quality, the more likely it is that the identifiers can be used to link up information across datasets. 

**Relevance**

The org-id.guide web application provides a search tool to locate relevant identifier lists. Search results are ranked by **relevance**. 

The more **relevant** a list for a given search, the more likely it is that it will contain the organization that a user is looking for. 

**Meta-data**

Each entry in org-id.guide has detailed meta-data and information that can be used to locate the identifiers that the list contains, whether through online search or open datasets. 

**What org-id.guide is not**

org-id.guide **does not** directly maintain organisation identifiers itself. Instead, it signposts to existing sources of identification: helping data publishers and users choose the best identifier schemes to use for their purpose.
